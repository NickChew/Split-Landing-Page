The code starts by creating a container element.
Then, it creates two elements: left and right.
The code then attaches event listeners to the left and right elements so that when the mouse enters or leaves them, they will change their class names from "hover-left" or "hover-right".
The code will add the class "hover-left" to the container element when a mouse enters it and remove it when a mouse leaves.
