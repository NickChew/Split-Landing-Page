The code starts with the <html> tag.
It then has a <head> tag that includes the meta tags, which are used to define the page's character encoding and viewport settings.
The next section is an empty div called "container".
This container will be split into two sections: one on the left side of the screen and one on the right side of the screen.
The first thing in this code is a link to style.css, which contains all of our CSS styles for this website.
Next comes a script tag that points to script.js, which contains all of our JavaScript code for this website (including jQuery).
After these tags come some HTML markup that defines what goes where on each half of our landing page: <div class="split left"> <h1>Playstation 5</h1> <a href="#" class="btn">Buy Now</a> </div><br /> <div class="split right"> <h1>XBox Series X</h1> <a href="#" class="btn">Buy Now</a></div><br />
The code is a split landing page.
The left side of the screen has an H1 tag with text "Playstation 5" and a button that says "Buy Now".
On the right side, there is an H1 tag with text "XBox Series X" and a button that says "Buy Now".
